# Monty_Hall_Problem
A brute force approach to the problem


As one of the most famous maths and probability problem I wanted to just brute force the output and check. The code is not the most compact or clear for a Monty Hall problem but it is good enough.

Just google it if you are not familiar with it.

## Output
I did the problem with 1 million iterations. The output?

With switching success rate is 66.6%

Without switching the success rate is only 33.33%
